<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>
  Now that you've read about the <code>XmlResource</code> class, let's put your
  skills to the test.
</p>

<h4>Importing from S4TK</h4>
<p>
  In order to use <code>XmlResource</code>, you're going to need to import it.
  Do that first.
</p>

<h4>Create New Tuning</h4>
<p>
  Use the constructor to create an <code>XmlResource</code> for the starting
  XML. Save it to a variable called <code>tuning</code>.
</p>

<h4>Update the DOM</h4>
<p>
  First, delete the <code>YOUNGADULT</code> enum node from <code>ages</code>*.
  Then, change the inner value of <code>trait_type</code> to
  <code>GAMEPLAY</code>.
</p>
<p>
  There's nothing too fancy here, just remember what you have to do to ensure
  that the content is kept in sync after you edit the DOM.

  * Recall from the XML DOMs tutorial that there is currently no built-in way to
  delete a node. For help, you can review
