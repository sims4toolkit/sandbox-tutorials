<h2>Reading and Writing XML</h2>
<p>
  An important aspect of <code>XmlResource</code>s is reading from and writing
  to XML files.
</p>

<h4>Reading XML</h4>
<p>
  Like any other resource, you can load existing data into an
  <code>XmlResource</code> model with its static
  <code>from(buffer: Buffer)</code> method. It accepts a buffer containing plain
  text XML data, and will load that data into its DOM.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>XmlResource.from()</code> method also accepts some optional
  arguments, but you usually do not have to worry about these. You can check out
  the documentation linked above for more information if you wish.
