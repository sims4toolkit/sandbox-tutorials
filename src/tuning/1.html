<h2>The DOM</h2>
<p>
  The content is plain text - it knows nothing about XML structure. If you want
  to edit a tuning document, you have to use its DOM.
</p>

<h4>Accessing the DOM</h4>
<p>
  The DOM is an <code>XmlDocumentNode</code> (from @s4tk/xml-dom), and can be
  accessed with the <code>dom</code> property.
</p>
<p>
  Since you're almost always going to want the DOM's child (i.e. the root), you
  can also use the <code>root</code> property, which is an alias for
  <code>dom.child</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have the DOM/root, you can get and set the values of nodes as you
  learned to do in the <a href="#/tutorials/xml-dom">XML DOMs tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h4>Content vs. DOM</h4>
<p>
  As mentioned previously, setting the <code>content</code> property will cause
  the DOM to regenerate. The inverse is also true - setting the
  <code>dom</code> property will automatically set the value of
  <code>content</code> to the result of <code>dom.toXml()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong class="danger">IMPORTANT:</strong> Editing nodes within the DOM will
  <em>not</em> automatically sync the content! Since the content is what is used
  in <code>getBuffer()</code>, your changes to the DOM will <em>not</em> be
  reflected when you write the tuning to a file.
</p>
<p>So... how do you save your changes to the DOM?</p>

<h4>Editing the DOM</h4>
<p>Since editing the DOM does not update the content, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Set the <code>dom</code> property equal to itself after you make your edits,
    which will then set <code>content</code> equal to <code>dom.toXml()</code>*
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit the DOM using <code>updateDom()</code> or <code>updateRoot()</code>,
    which update the content when they finish
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Setting the DOM equal to itself is less readible and more prone to error, so
  using <code>updateDom()</code> / <code>updateRoot()</code> is preferred.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  * If you're thinking of using <code>content = dom.toXml()</code> yourself,
  Just Don't&#8482;. It is strongly discouraged as it would unnecessarily reset
  the DOM.
</p>
