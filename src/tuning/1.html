<h2>The XML DOM</h2>
<p>
  Assuming its content is valid XML, you can access an XML resource's DOM with
  its <code>dom</code> property.
</p>

<h4>Accessing The DOM</h4>
<p>
  The DOM is an <code>XmlDocumentNode</code>, and can be get/set* with the
  <code>dom</code> property. Since you're almost always going to want the DOM's
  child, the root, you can also use the <code>root</code> property (an alias for
  <code>dom.child</code>).
</p>
<p>
  It's important to note that editing the DOM does
  <strong>NOT</strong> automatically update the content. And, since the content
  is the source of truth, that means that edits made to the DOM will not be
  reflected the next time you use <code>content</code> or call
  <code>getBuffer()</code>.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  * When setting <code>dom</code>/<code>root</code>, note that the
  <code>content</code> property gets automatically reset to the value of
  <code>dom.toXml()</code>.
</p>

<h4>Editing The DOM</h4>
<p>
  Since editing the DOM does not automatically update the content, you have two
  options:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Set the <code>dom</code> property equal to itself after you make your edits,
    which will then set <code>content</code> equal to <code>dom.toXml()</code>*
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit the DOM using the <code>updateDom()</code> / <code>updateRoot()</code>
    methods, which automatically update the content when they finish
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  While there's nothing wrong with setting the DOM to itself, it is less
  readible and more prone to error (e.g. forgetting what it's for and deleting
  it, or forgetting to do it in the first place).
</p>
<p>
  So, the second approach (using the <code>updateDom()</code> /
  <code>updateRoot()</code> methods) is preferred, and it's good to get into the
  habit of using them right away.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  * You may be thinking that <code>content = dom.toXml()</code> is a third
  option, but it is strongly discouraged, as doing so would delete the DOM and
  require it to be regenerated.
</p>
