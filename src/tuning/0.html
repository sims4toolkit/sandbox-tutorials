<h2>XmlResource</h2>
<p>
  When dealing with XML resources (like tuning or ASMs), you'll need to use the
  <code>XmlResource</code> class from @s4tk/models.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with @s4tk/xml-dom. If you are
  not, you should read the <a href="#/tutorials/xml-dom">XML DOMs tutorial</a>
  before this one.
</p>

<h4>Creating New Tuning</h4>
<p>
  To create a new, empty tuning file, you can use
  <code>new XmlResource()</code> with no arguments.
</p>
<p>
  If you have initial content to use, you can pass either a string or an
  <code>XmlDocumentNode</code> (from @s4tk/xml-dom) as an argument to the
  constructor.
</p>

<h4>Loading Tuning From File</h4>
<p>
  Like all other resources, the <code>XmlResource</code> class has a static
  <code>from(buffer: Buffer)</code> method that can be used to load an existing
  tuning file into an <code>XmlResource</code> object.
</p>
<p>
  This tutorial supplies a sample tuning file called "Sample.xml", and you can
  load it as a buffer with <code>Sandbox.import()</code>.
</p>

<h4>The Content</h4>
<p>
  The "content" of an XML resource is a string that contains its XML as plain
  text. You can get/set* it with the <code>content</code> property.
</p>
<p>
  The content is the source of truth for XML resources. That is, it is used in
  <code>getBuffer()</code>, so whatever the content is is what gets written to
  files and packages.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  * Setting <code>content</code> will regenerate the DOM. There is a somewhat
  complex relationship between the content and DOM. This will be discussed
  further on the next page.
