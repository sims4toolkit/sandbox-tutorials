<h2>Writing to Files</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes, you may want to write an <code>XmlResource</code>'s content to an
  XML file, such as when you're extracting tuning from the game.
</p>

<h4>Getting the Buffer</h4>
<p>
  Like every other resource, you can get an <code>XmlResource</code>'s buffer
  with <code>getBuffer()</code>. Once you have the buffer, you can write it to a
  file using whatever your environment allows.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  In Node, you'd use the
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html" target="_blank">fs</a> module to
  write your buffer to a file, rather than <code>Sandbox.download()</code>.
