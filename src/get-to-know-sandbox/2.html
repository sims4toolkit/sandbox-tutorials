<h2>Node Parity</h2>
<p>
  Although the sandbox uses browser JavaScript, it is intended to mock a Node
  environment. As such, the sandbox provides implementations for some Node
  features, such as <code>require()</code> and <code>Buffer</code>.
</p>

<h4>Importing S4TK Modules</h4>
<p>
  You can import S4TK modules exactly as you would in Node, using
  <code>require()</code>. Imports in this sandbox are at full parity with the
  S4TK Node library, so you can copy your code directly into Node and it should
  "just work" (minus the <code>Sandbox</code> functions).
</p>
<p>
  However, since this is a browser, you do NOT have access to any Node modules
  other than S4TK. This includes <code>fs</code>, the Node file system. When
  converting S4TK scripts from the sandbox to Node, you'll have to replace
  <code>import()</code> with <code>readFileSync()</code> and
  <code>download()</code> with <code>writeFileSync()</code>.
</p>

<h4>Buffers</h4>
<p>
  Buffers are very important in S4TK, as they are used to read and write files.
  The buffers returned from <code>import()</code> and resources'
  <code>getBuffer()</code> methods are at full parity with buffers in Node.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, if you need to use the <code>Buffer</code> class (you probably don't,
  but in case you do), you can use it just as you would in Node - no import
  required.
</p>

<h4>Final Notes</h4>
<p>
  If you see code in this script that you don't understand, such as
  <code>StringTableResource</code> and <code>formatStringKey()</code>, don't
  worry about it. These are explained in other tutorials.
