<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to the S4TK Sandbox. This website is intended to make S4TK more
  accessible by removing the need to set up your own Node environment.
</p>
<p>
  In order to get the best out of this website, you should understand how it
  works. That's what this tutorial is here for.
</p>

<h4>Main Editor vs. Tutorials</h4>
<p>
  There are two primary features of this website. The first is where you are
  now, in an interactive tutorial. The second is the main code editor, in which
  you have access to a file system and can write, save, and run any scripts you
  want.
</p>
<p>
  To access the main code editor (once you're done with this tutorial), click
  the <img src="./assets/terminal-outline.svg" class="inline-svg" /> button in
  the navbar. To come back to tutorials, click
  <img src="./assets/book-outline.svg" class="inline-svg" />.
</p>
<p>
  For now, don't worry about the main code editor and file system - they'll be
  mentioned as needed throughout this tutorial, and you'll be prepared to use
  them by the end.
</p>

<h4>Tutorial Guide</h4>
<p>
  The tutorial guide is what you are reading right now. It is only available in
  tutorial mode, and is replaced with a file manager in the main editor. You can
  resize this window by dragging the edge between it and the script editor.
</p>
<p>
  Some tutorials, such as this one, consist of multiple pages. You go back and
  forth, you can use the Back (<img
    src="./assets/chevron-left.svg"
    class="inline-svg"
  />) and Next (<img src="./assets/chevron-right.svg" class="inline-svg" />)
  buttons at the bottom of the tutorial guide.
</p>

<h4>The Script Editor</h4>
<p>
  The script editor is the window to the right of this one. You can type,
  copy/paste, undo/redo, and even find/replace using your computer's standard
  keyboard shortcuts.
</p>
<p>
  You can edit the content to whatever you want, but you cannot save these edits
  while in tutorial mode - if you leave/refresh this page, the editor content
  will reset.
</p>
<p>
  When using the main editor/file system, you <em>can</em> save your changes,
  and they will be here waiting for you if you leave the site and come back. In
  fact, you can save as many scripts as you'd like - that's what the file system
  is for.
</p>

<h4>The Console</h4>
<p>
  The console is the window below the editor. You can resize it by dragging the
  edge between it and the script editor.
</p>
<p>
  Its purpose is to show the output generated by your script. Errors will
  automatically be logged in the console, but there are ways you can write to it
  yourself.
</p>
<p>
  <code>Sandbox.output(...args: string[])</code> will write the arguments it is
  given separated by newlines.
  <code>Sandbox.test(name: string, condition: boolean)</code> will check the
  value of the condition and print out a pass/fail message accordingly.
</p>

<h4>The Toolbar</h4>
<p>
  The toolbar is the set of buttons in the bottom-right of your screen. In
  tutorial mode, these buttons include:
</p>
<p>
  Download (<img src="./assets/download.svg" class="inline-svg" />) will
  download the contents of the editor as a JavaScript (.js) file.
</p>
<p>
  Reset (<img src="./assets/refresh.svg" class="inline-svg" />) will reset the
  contents of the editor to how they were at the start of the tutorial.
</p>
<p>
  Run (<img src="./assets/play.svg" class="inline-svg" />) will run the contents
  of the editor as a script and write its output to the console.
</p>
