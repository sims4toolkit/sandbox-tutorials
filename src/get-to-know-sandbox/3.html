<h2>Writing & Running Scripts</h2>
<p>
  Now that you're familiar with the sandbox interface, functions, and Node
  compatibility, you're almost ready to get started with the main editor and
  file system.
</p>
<p>
  But, before you go clicking that
  <img src="./assets/terminal-outline.svg" class="inline-svg" /> button, here
  are a couple of final notes.
</p>

<h4>Saving Scripts</h4>
<p>
  For performance reasons, the script does not autosave as you type. When you're
  in the main editor, you'll see an indicator at the top of your file letting
  you know when you have unsaved changes.
</p>
<p>
  To save your script, you can press the Save (<img
    src="./assets/save-outline.svg"
    class="inline-svg"
  />) button in the toolbar (only available in the main editor). Alternatively,
  your script will also be saved every time you download or run your script, or
  when you switch between files.
</p>
<p>If you close the website without saving your changes, you will lose them.</p>

<h4>Running Scripts in Scripts</h4>
<p>
  The scripts you have saved in your file system are allowed to call each other
  by name, and can even pass values to one another. Since each individual script
  is wrapped in an asynchronous function, you can use the
  <code>return</code> keyword in one script, and <code>await</code> when calling
  it in another.
</p>
<p>
  Tutorials do NOT have access to the file system, and therefore cannot run
  other scripts. If you run the script for this page, you'll see an error.
</p>
<p>
  To call a script from another script, use
  <code>Sandbox.runScript(filename: string)</code>. Like <code>import()</code>,
  this is an async function, so you <strong>must</strong> use the
  <code>await</code> keyword in order to get its value.
</p>

<h4>You're Done!</h4>
<p>
  It's time to check out the main editor and file system - click
  <img src="./assets/terminal-outline.svg" class="inline-svg" /> in the navbar
  to get there.
</p>
<p>
  Once in the main editor, you'll see an example script that demonstrates
  everything you'd read about in this tutorial. The script "helloWorld" gets a
  string table from the "loadSampleSTBL" script, which reads the
  "SampleSTBL.stbl" media file into a <code>StringTableResource</code> object.
</p>
