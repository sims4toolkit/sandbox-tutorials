<h2>Sandbox Functions</h2>
<p>
  The sandbox has several built-in functions, such as <code>output()</code> and
  <code>test()</code> which were mentioned on the previous page. This page will
  teach you about the other sandbox functions.
</p>

<h4>The File System</h4>
<p>
  In the file system, there are two types of files: scripts and media. Scripts
  are the JavaScript files that you write & run, and media files can contain any
  data you want, such as JSON, string tables, or packages. Scripts can import
  media files and use them however they please.
</p>
<p>
  Tutorials do not have access to the main sandbox's file system, but some of
  them provide files of their own. This tutorial provides a media file called
  "Sample.stbl", which is a string table containing one entry.
</p>

<h4>Importing Media Files</h4>
<p>
  You can import media files with <code>Sandbox.import(filename: string)</code>,
  which is an <strong>async</strong> function that returns a Buffer. The scripts
  you write are executed in the context of an async function, which means you
  are allowed to use top-level <code>await</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If that last paragraph went over your head, don't worry about it - just look
  at how the <code>import()</code> function is used in the sample script and use
  it like that. Note that using <code>await</code> is
  <strong>very</strong> important - if you forget it, the import function will
  not return the value you're expecting it to.
</p>

<h4>Downloading Files</h4>
<p>
  You can download anything you want using the
  <code>Sandbox.download(filename: string, content: string | Buffer)</code>
  function.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>download()</code> function will not download your file immediately,
  but rather it will queue it to be downloaded when the script is done. If only
  one file is queued, it will download as-is. If multiple files are queued, they
  will be zipped and then downloaded as one. This means that you can use
  <code>download()</code> multiple times, or even in a loop, and you don't have
  to worry about it cluttering your downloads folder.
</p>
<p>
  After running this script, a file called
  "Get_to_Know_the_Sandbox.downloads.zip" should automatically download, and it
  should contain two files: "MyStbl.stbl" and "MyText.txt".
