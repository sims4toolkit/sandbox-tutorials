<h2>FNV Hashing</h2>
<p>
  When adding resources to packages, you're going to need a hash to use for its
  instance ID. That's what @s4tk/hashing is for.
</p>

<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>
  The two functions you're going to need the most are
  <code>fnv32(text: string)</code> and <code>fnv64(text: string)</code>. These
  produce 32-bit and 64-bit FNV hashes, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  If you'd like to force the high bit to 1, you can do so by passing
  <code>true</code> as the second argument.
