  Congrats! You're done learning about XML DOMs for now. For more information,
  visit the docs linked above.

<p>
  Now that you understand XML DOMs, I'd recommend checking out
  <a href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/tunables" target="_blank"
    >@s4tk/tunables</a
  >. It is an S4TK module of utility functions that make creating tuning DOMs
  easier, such as the <code>T()</code> function that creates a
  <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> node.
