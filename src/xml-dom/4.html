<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
  Other than manually getting, setting, and adding parts of the DOM, there are
  some helper methods that you may find useful.
</p>

<h4>Finding Children</h4>
<p>
  So far, you've been getting child nodes by their index. However, this is
  pretty impractical, since you'll rarely know what the index is, and it is
  likely to change whenever you update your file anyways.
</p>
<p>
  That's where <code>findChild(name: string)</code> comes in. It will search the
  children list for the first child that has the given name.
</p>

<h4>Sorting Children</h4>
<p>
  Keeping your tunables in alphabetical order by name is important for
  readability, but can be tedious when you're programmatically adding children
  to the end of the list.
</p>
<p>
  And for this, we have <code>sort()</code>. This method can optionally accept a
  function to use for sorting, but you're unlikely to need it - by default, it
  will sort children alphabetically by their <code>n</code> attribute.
