<h2>Creating New Nodes</h2>
<p>
  So far, you've seen how to parse an XML document and how to get/set individual
  values within nodes. This page will show you how to create and add new nodes.
</p>

<h4>Using Constructors</h4>
<p>
  Each node type has its own respective constructor. You can check the
  documentation linked above for more information about the expected arguments,
  and the script editor for examples of them being used.
</p>
<p>
  To actually add the new nodes after you create them with their constructors,
  you can use the node's <code>addChildren()</code> method, which accepts an
  arbitrary number of nodes to add to the end of the <code>children</code> list.
</p>

<h4>Using @s4tk/tunables</h4>
<p>
  There is an S4TK module that exists for the sole purpose of making this
  process easier, it is called
  <a href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/tunables" target="_blank"
    >@s4tk/tunables</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  This module contains helper functions that make your code more readible and
  require less arguments. For instance, compare lines 32-41 with lines 69-73 in
  the script editor.
</p>

<h4>Using Clones</h4>
<p>
  You can clone nodes with the <code>clone()</code> method. This will return a
  deep copy of the node, meaning that it and all of its children are new
  instances with the same values as before.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have a clone, you can edit it. This is particularly handy when
  dealing with lists, since their children tend to have similar, if not the
  same, structure.
