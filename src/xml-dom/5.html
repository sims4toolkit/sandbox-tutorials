<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>Now that you've read about XML DOMs, let's put your skills to the test.</p>

<h4>Importing from S4TK</h4>
<p>
  You're going to need <code>XmlDocumentNode</code>, so go ahead and import that
  now. You can import other items as they're needed later.
</p>

<h4>Creating the Document</h4>
<p>
  You're allowed to create your document from the starting XML, just like the
  previous pages told you. Go ahead and do that now, saving it to a variable
  called <code>root</code>.
</p>

<h4>Update Tunable Values</h4>
<p>
  You'll need to get a reference to the <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> node, and then
  change the value and comment in it.
</p>

<h4>Add Enums to List</h4>
<p>
  You'll need to get a reference to the <code>&lt;L&gt;</code> node, and then
  add two <code>&lt;E&gt;</code> children with the correct values.
</p>

<h4>Sorting the Nodes</h4>
<p>
  Right now, you have a node named "tunable" coming before a node named "list".
  These should be sorted alphabetically. Go ahead and do that, and you should be
  all set.
