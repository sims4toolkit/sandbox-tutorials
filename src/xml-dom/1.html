<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>
  As mentioned on the last page, attributes are key/value pairs. In tuning, they
  appear on the root node, its children, children of tuples, and variants.
</p>

<h4>Attribute Aliases</h4>
<p>
  On the previous page, you read that you can access attributes with the
  <code>attributes</code> property. However, for some common attributes
  (<code>n</code>, <code>s</code>, and <code>t</code>), there are aliases
  available.
</p>
<p>
  To get the <code>n</code> attribute of a node, you can use <code>name</code>.
  For <code>s</code>, you can use <code>id</code>. And finally, for
  <code>t</code>, you can use <code>type</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For any other attributes (like <code>c</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>i</code>,
  and <code>p</code>), you <strong>must</strong> use the
  <code>attributes</code> property and get them by name. These attributes do not
  have aliases for two reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>You're unlikely to need them.</li>
  <li>There are no good options*.</li>
</ol>
<p class="footnote">
  *<code>class</code>/<code>module</code> are reserved words and cannot be used
  for <code>c</code>/<code>m</code>; <code>instanceType</code> is too long and
  <code>type</code> is taken by <code>t</code>, neither is good option for
  <code>i</code>; who the hell cares about <code>p</code>?
</p>

<h4>Editing Attributes</h4>
<p>
  To add a new attribute or change the value of an existing one, all you have to
  do is set it, like <code>node.attributes.n = "something"</code>. To delete an
  existing attribute, you need to use <code>delete node.attributes.n</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Valid values for attributes include strings, numbers, and bigints. Note that
  parsing an XML document will <strong>always</strong> return them as strings,
  because parsing them as numbers would cause precision errors with 64-bit
  tuning IDs. If you need the instance to be a bigint, you must cast it with
  <code>BigInt()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  It's important to note that you are <strong>not</strong> allowed to set the
  <code>attributes</code> property itself to a new object. You
  <strong>must</strong> mutate the existing one*.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  * This is a remnant from how S4TK used to handle buffer cacheing, and may be
  changed in the future. But, for now, attempting to set
  <code>attributes</code> to a new object will throw an error, so don't do it.
