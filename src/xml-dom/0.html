<h2>XML Documents</h2>
<p>
  XML is a data format that means nothing on its own. In order for it to have
  meaning, it must be loaded into a Document Object Model (DOM). The S4TK module
  that handles XML DOMs is called @s4tk/xml-dom.
</p>

<h4>Nodes</h4>
<p>
  At the core of XML DOMs are <strong>nodes</strong>. "Node" is a vague term for
  pretty much anything in an XML DOM, such as an element/tag (like
  <code>&lt;T /&gt;</code>), a value (like <code>0x00000000</code>), or a
  comment (like <code>&lt;!--...--&gt;</code>).
</p>
<p>
  Some nodes, like elements, are able to contain other nodes. These are called
  <strong>parents</strong>, and the nodes they contain are their
  <strong>children</strong>. For example, an <code>&lt;L /&gt;</code> node that
  contains several <code>&lt;T /&gt;</code> nodes is a parent, and the
  <code>&lt;T /&gt;</code> nodes are its children.
</p>
<p>
  Everything in an XML DOM is a node, including the document itself. The
  document node is just a wrapper for the node(s) at the highest level, i.e. the
  node(s) from which all other nodes descend. In properly structured XML, there
  should only be one* node without a parent, such as <code>&lt;I /&gt;</code>.
  This child is called the <strong>root</strong>.
</p>

  * The line that begins with "&lt;?xml" is called a processing instruction, and
  can be ignored for the sake of this lesson.
</p>

<h4>Parsing XML Documents</h4>
<p>
  If the last section was too abstract for you to digest, take a look at the
  script editor for a real example. In the XML document created for the
  <code>doc</code> variable, <code>&lt;I&gt;</code> is the root node. It is a
  parent with one child, <code>&lt;L&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;L&gt;</code> is also
  a parent to the two <code>&lt;U&gt;</code> nodes, and each
  <code>&lt;U&gt;</code> is a parent to a <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> and an
  <code>&lt;E&gt;</code>. Even those <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;E&gt;</code> nodes are parents - their children are the value and
  comment nodes they contain, but we'll get back to that later.
</p>
<p>
  You'll notice that the XML string is being parsed into a DOM with
  <code>XmlDocumentNode.from(xml: string | Buffer)</code>. This static method
  returns an instance of the <code>XmlDocumentNode</code> class, which
  represents an XML document for the given string/buffer.
</p>

<h4>The Root Node</h4>
<p>
  As mentioned before, the root of this document is <code>&lt;I&gt;</code>, as
  it is the node from which everything else descends. To access it, you can use
  the <code>doc</code>'s <code>child</code> property (the
  <code>children</code> property is a list of all of a node's children, and
  <code>child</code> is just an alias for <code>children[0]</code>).
</p>
<p>
  In the vast majority of XML documents, and 100% of TS4 XML documents, the root
  node is going to be an element. Elements are nodes that have a tag,
  attributes, and children. You'll read more about these on the next page.
