<h2>About XML DOMs</h2>
<p>
  As a TS4 modder, you're likely familiar with XML structure. However, in order
  to work with XML in a script, you must also understand XML DOMs.
</p>
<p>
  XML is a data format that means nothing on its own. In order for it to have
  meaning, it must be loaded into a Document Object Model (DOM). The S4TK module
  that handles XML DOMs is called @s4tk/xml-dom.
</p>

<h4>Nodes</h4>
<p>
  At the core of XML DOMs are <strong>nodes</strong>. "Node" is a vague term for
  pretty much anything in an XML DOM, such as a tag (like &lt;T /&gt;), a value
  (like 0x00000000), or a comment (like &lt;!--...--&gt;).
</p>
<p>
  Some nodes, like tags, are able to contain other nodes. These are called
  <strong>parents</strong>, and the nodes they contain are their
  <strong>children</strong>. For example, an &lt;L /&gt; tag that contains
  several &lt;T /&gt; tags is a parent, and the &lt;T /&gt; tags are its
  children.
</p>
<p>
  Everything in an XML DOM is a node, including the document itself. The
  document node is just a wrapper for the nodes that do not have a visible
  parent. In properly structured XML, there should only be one* node without a
  parent, such as the &lt;I /&gt; in instance tuning or &lt;M /&gt; in module
  tuning. This one child is called the <strong>root</strong>.
</p>

    >* You may see one more node - the line that begins with "&lt;?xml". This is
    called a processing instruction, and can be ignored for the sake of this
    lesson.</em

<h4>XML Documents</h4>
<p>
  If the last section was too abstract for you to digest, take a look at the
  script editor for a real example. In the XML document created for the
  <code>doc</code> variable, <code>&lt;I&gt;</code> is the root node. It is a
  parent with one child, <code>&lt;L&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;L&gt;</code> is also
  a parent to the two <code>&lt;U&gt;</code> nodes, and each
  <code>&lt;U&gt;</code> is a parent to a <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> and an
  <code>&lt;E&gt;</code>. Even those <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> and
  <code>&lt;E&gt;</code> nodes are parents - their children are the value and
  comment nodes they contain, but we'll get back to that later.
</p>
<p>
  You'll notice that the XML string is being parsed into a DOM with
  <code>XmlDocumentNode.from(xml: string | Buffer)</code>. This static method
  returns an instance of the <code>XmlDocumentNode</code> class, which
  represents an XML document.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned before, the root of this document is <code>&lt;I&gt;</code>, as
  it is the node from which everything else descends. To access it, you can use
  the <code>doc</code>'s <code>child</code> property (the
  <code>children</code> property is a list of all of a node's children, and
  <code>child</code> is just an alias for <code>children[0]</code>).
</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p>
  Attributes are the key/value pairs that appear within opening tags, such as
  the <code>n="tunable"</code> in <code>&lt;T n="tunable"&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
  We'll touch more on attributes on the next page, but for now, just know that
  you can access a tag's attributes with its <code>attributes</code> property.
  Once you have that, you can just use the attribute's key to get its value,
  like <code>attributes.n</code> or <code>attributes["n"]</code> (these do the
  same thing).
