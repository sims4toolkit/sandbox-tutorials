<h2>Value & Comment Nodes</h2>
<p>
  Value nodes are much simpler than element nodes. They are just a single value,
  such as a string, number, or boolean. Comments are even easier, as they are
  just a string.
</p>

<h4>Parsing Values</h4>
<p>
  Like attributes of elements, the XML parser will always load the value of an
  <code>XmlValueNode</code> as a string, even if it's a number. This is again
  due to precision errors with 64 bit numbers. If you need the value as a
  number, you must parse it with
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>BigInt()</code></a
  >.
</p>

<h4>Getting & Setting Values</h4>
<p>
  You can get or set the value of both <code>XmlValueNode</code>s and
  <code>XmlCommentNode</code>s with their <code>value</code> property.
