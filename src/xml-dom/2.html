<h2>Value & Comment Nodes</h2>
<p>
  Value nodes are much simpler than element nodes. They are just a single value,
  such as a string, number, or boolean. Comments are even easier, as they are
  just a string.
</p>

<h4>Getting & Setting Values</h4>
<p>
  You can get or set the value of both <code>XmlValueNode</code>s and
  <code>XmlCommentNode</code>s with their <code>value</code> property.
</p>
<p>
  If you have an element node and would like to get the value of the
  value/comment node within it, you can use <code>innerValue</code> (an alias
  for <code>child.value</code>).
</p>
<p>
  Setting <code>value</code> to strings, numbers, and bigints should work as you
  expect, but keep in mind that booleans will write with a capitalized first
  letter (<code>True</code> and <code>False</code>).
</p>

<h4>Note on Parsed Values</h4>
<p>
  Like the attributes of elements, the XML parser always loads the value of an
  <code>XmlValueNode</code> as a string, even if it's a number. This is again
  due to precision errors with 64 bit numbers. If you need the value as a
  number, you must parse it with
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>BigInt()</code></a
  >.
</p>
