<h2>Package Binaries</h2>
<p>
  To load an existing package into a <code>Package</code>, or to save one as a
  file, you need to work with binary DBPF buffers.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  "DBPF" stands for "Database Packed File", and it is the name of the binary
  format that package files use. You don't really need to know this, but I'm
  telling you anyways &#10024;.
</p>

<h4>Reading a DBPF Buffer</h4>
<p>
  First, you have to get a buffer that contains binary package data, and then
  load that buffer into a <code>Package</code> with <code>from(buffer)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This tutorial provides a package named "Sample.package" - you can import it
  with <code>await Sandbox.import()</code>.
</p>

<h4>Writing a DBPF Buffer</h4>
<p>
  To save a <code>Package</code> object as a file, you have to get its buffer
  with the <code>getBuffer()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
  In the sandbox, you can use <code>Sandbox.download(filename, buffer)</code> to
  save the package to your computer.
</p>

<h4>Note about Node</h4>
<p>
  When using S4TK in Node, remember that <code>import()</code> and
  <code>download()</code> are not available. You'll have to use the
  <code>fs</code> Node module to read & write files.
