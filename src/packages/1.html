<h2>Package Binaries</h2>
<p>
  To load an existing package into a <code>Package</code>, or to save one as a
  file, you need to work with binary DBPF buffers.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  "DBPF" stands for "Database Packed File", and it is the name of the binary
  format that package files use. You don't really need to know this, but I'm
  telling you anyways &#10024;.

<h4>Note about Node</h4>
<p>
  When using S4TK in Node, remember that <code>import()</code> and
  <code>download()</code> are not available. You'll have to use the
  <code>fs</code> Node module to read & write files.
