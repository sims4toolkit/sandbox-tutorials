<h2>Extracting from Packages</h2>
<p>
  If all you need are the resources, rather than the package itself, then you
  can extract them and forego the <code>Package</code> object.
</p>

<h4>Extracting Resources</h4>
<p>
  The static <code>extractResources(buffer)</code> method accepts a DBPF buffer
  as an argument, parses it, and returns a list of
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/types/ResourceKeyPair"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>ResourceKeyPair</code></a
  >
  objects, which have <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> properties.
</p>
<p>
  These key/value pairs are just like entries, except they do not belong to any
  mapped model.
</p>

<h4>Optional Arguments</h4>
<p>
  The <code>extractResources(buffer, options?)</code> method accepts a second
  argument, which is an object of
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/types/PackageFileReadingOptions"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>PackageFileReadingOptions</code></a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most useful options is
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/types/ResourceFilter"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>resourceFilter</code></a
  >, which lets you include or exclude resources based on their resource key.
  For instance, you can choose to extract string tables only, and ignore all
  other file types.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  You can read through the other options if you'd like, but don't worry about it
  if you don't want to. Chances are, you're never going to need the other
  options.
</p>

<h4>Final Notes</h4>
<p>
  Obviously, the main purpose of extraction is to extract tuning from the game.
  For that, you can use
  <a href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/extraction" target="_blank"
    >@s4tk/extraction</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  It is impossible to demo game file extraction in the browser for two reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The browser does not have access to your local file system</li>
  <li>
    @s4tk/extraction is not just JavaScript, it uses some C bindings to optimize
    the extraction process
  </li>
</ul>
