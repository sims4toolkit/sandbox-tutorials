<h2>Package</h2>
<p>
  When dealing with packages, you'll need to use the <code>Package</code> class
  from @s4tk/models.

<h4>Creating Package</h4>
<p>To create a new, empty package, you can use <code>new Package()</code>.</p>
<p>
  If you want to create a package with existing entries, you can pass a list of
  key/resource pairs as the first argument to the constructor. Check the docs if
  you want more information.
</p>

  Tip: Never use the name "package" for a variable, as <code>package</code> is a
  reserved word in JavaScript - I usually stick with "pkg".
