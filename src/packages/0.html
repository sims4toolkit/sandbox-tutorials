<h2>Package</h2>
<p>
  When dealing with packages, you'll need to use the <code>Package</code> class
  from @s4tk/models.

<h4>Creating a Package</h4>
<p>To create a new, empty package, you can use <code>new Package()</code>.</p>
<p>
  If you want to create a package with existing entries, you can pass a list of
  key/resource pairs as the first argument to the constructor. Check the docs if
  you want more information.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Tip: Never use the name "package" for a variable, as <code>package</code> is a
  reserved word in JavaScript - I usually stick with "pkg".
</p>

<h4>Adding Entries</h4>
<p>
  To add an entry, you need a resource and a resource key. A resource key is an
  object with <code>type</code>, <code>group</code>, and <code>instance</code>
  properties.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have a resource and its key, you can add them to the package with the
  <code>add(key: ResourceKey, value: Resource)</code> method.
</p>

<h4>Getting Entries</h4>
<p>
  Since a package is a mapped model, each key/value pair is called an
  <strong>entry</strong>. Specifically, the entries in a package are of the type
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/types/ResourceEntry"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>ResourceEntry</code></a
  >, which has <code>id</code>, <code>key</code>, and
  <code>value</code> properties.
</p>
<p>You can get a resource entry by its...</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID: <code>get(id: number)</code></li>
  <li>Key: <code>getByKey(key: ResourceKey)</code></li>
  <li>Value: <code>getByValue(value: Resource)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally, you can use the <code>entries</code> property, which is a list
  of all of the entries in the package. You can use this list to get entries by
  their index, or to loop/iterate over all of the entries.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Note that adding/removing entries to/from the <code>entries</code> list will
  NOT add/remove them from the package - you MUST use the add/delete methods.
</p>

<h4>Editing Entries</h4>
<p>
  Once you have a <code>ResourceEntry</code> object, editing it is as easy as
  editing the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> properties.
</p>
<p>
  You can either set these to entirely new keys and resources, or you can mutate
  the existing key/resource.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Note that resource entries also have a property called
  <code>resource</code>, which is just an alias for <code>value</code>.
</p>

<h4>Deleting Entries</h4>
<p>You can delete a resource entry by its...</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID: <code>delete(id: number)</code></li>
  <li>Key: <code>deleteByKey(key: ResourceKey)</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="footnote">
  If you're confused about IDs vs. keys, it is explained in the
  <a href="#/tutorials/intro-to-s4tk" target="_blank">Intro to S4TK tutorial</a
  >.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  For posterity, the key is what actually gets written to the package, and the
  ID is a unique identifier that S4TK uses internally (just in case any keys are
  repeated).
