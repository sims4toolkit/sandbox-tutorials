<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>
  Now that you've read about the <code>Package</code> class, let's put your
  skills to the test.
</p>

<h4>Importing from S4TK</h4>
<p>
  In order to use <code>Package</code>, you need to import it. So... do that. Do
  it now. Hurry. Chop chop.
</p>

<h4>Create a Package</h4>
<p>
  You'll need a package to add resources to, so make an empty one and assign it
  to a variable called <code>pkg</code>.
</p>

<h4>Create a Resource Key</h4>
<p>
  Let's create a resource key for an English string table. The instance should
  be the FNV 64 hash of "MyStringTable".
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Hint: You'll have to import the hashing function and two enums. Don't forget
  to set the locale code in the instance.
</p>

<h4>Import a STBL</h4>
<p>
  This isn't a challenge for STBLs, so don't bother making one from scratch. You
  can use
  <code>StringTableResource.from(await Sandbox.import("English.stbl"))</code> to
  load a stbl into a variable called <code>stbl</code>.
</p>

<h4>Add STBL to the PKG</h4>
<p>
  Add <code>stbl</code> to your package using <code>resourceKey</code> as its
  key.
</p>

<h4>Get the Buffer</h4>
<p>
  Save the package's buffer to a variable called <code>pkgBuffer</code>. This
  step is important, because it's what your code will be tested against.
