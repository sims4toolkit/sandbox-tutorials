<h2>Welcome to S4TK</h2>
<p>
  S4TK's tagline is that it can "read and write package files and the resources
  they contain", but what does that mean?
</p>

<h4>Terminology</h4>
<p>
  Packages are just a data format, somewhat similar to a ZIP archive, and mean
  nothing on their own. What really matters are the <strong>resources</strong>
  they contain, such as tuning, string tables, SimData, object definitions, etc.
</p>
<p>
  S4TK is driven by <strong>models</strong>, which are just classes that
  represent data. S4TK has models for packages and resources, and they are all
  defined in the @s4tk/models npm package.
</p>
<p>
  S4TK models can be read from and written to <strong>buffers</strong>, which
  are fixed-length lists of bytes containing data. This data can either be
  binary, like packages, or plain text, like XML.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Do not worry - you don't need to understand binary file formats or how buffers
  work to use S4TK. Using the
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html" target="_blank">fs</a> Node module,
  you can read/write buffers from/to files.
</p>

  If you'd like to learn more about buffers, check out the documentation for
  Node's
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html" target="_blank">Buffer</a> class.
