<h2>Keys & Enums</h2>
<p>
  You'll be working with resource keys a lot, and S4TK has several enums to help
  you with them. While you don't need to know everything about these enums just
  yet, you should be familiar with which ones are used for what.
</p>

<h4>Types</h4>
<p>
  For tuning types like actions and snippets, you can use the
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/enums/TuningResourceType"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>TuningResourceType</code></a
  >
  enum. For binary file types like string tables and SimData, you can use the
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/enums/BinaryResourceType"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>BinaryResourceType</code></a
  >
  enum.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  The reason tuning and binary types are split into two enums is so you can use
  <code>type in TuningResourceType</code> to determine if a resource is tuning
  based on its type.
</p>

<h4>Groups</h4>
<p>
  For most resources, the group number does not matter and should be set to 0.
  However, for SimData, the group serves as a secondary type, and
  <strong>must</strong> be the 24-bit version of its associated tuning's type.
  For SimData groups, you can use the
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/enums/SimDataGroup"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>SimDataGroup</code></a
  >
  enum.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Not every tuning type has an associated SimData group, and not every SimData
  group is the 24-bit version of its 32-bit tuning type. These are general
  patterns, but there are exceptions.
</p>

<h4>Instances</h4>
<p>
  Instances are the unique part of resource keys, and there is therefore no enum
  for them. However, the top byte of string table instances
  <strong>must</strong> match their locale, and there <em>is</em> an enum for
  that -
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/enums/StringTableLocale"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>StringTableLocale</code></a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>StringTableLocale</code> enum also has some helper functions that
  will set the high byte of an instance for you. This is briefly demoed in the
  script editor, but you'll read more about it in the string table tutorial.
</p>

<h4>Hashing</h4>
<p>
  Another very important aspect of resource keys is FNV hashing. If you want to
  learn how to generate FNV hashes using S4TK, you should check out the very
  brief <a href="#/tutorials/hashing">hashing tutorial</a> when you are done
  with this one.
