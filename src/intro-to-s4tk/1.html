<h2>Model Bases</h2>
<p>
  While not something you'd normally concern yourself with, it may be worth
  reading about the base classes that various models descend from, since they
  define common behavior.
</p>
<p>
  Don't feel like you have to remember or even understand the code presented for
  this tutorial. The sole purpose here is to demonstrate how similar two
  completely different models can be, thanks to the base classes they inherit
  from.
</p>

<h4>Writable Models</h4>
<p>
  The
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/abstracts/WritableModel"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>WritableModel</code></a
  >
  base class defines behavior that is shared between
  <strong>every</strong> model that can be written to disk.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most important methods to know about is the static
  <code>from(buffer: Buffer)</code> method that every model implements. It
  accepts a buffer of data to load into the model, such as a binary STBL or
  plain text XML.
</p>
<p>
  Another important method to know about is <code>getBuffer()</code>, which
  returns an uncompressed buffer of the model's data - this is the inverse of
  the <code>from()</code> method.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Check the docs for more information about the optional arguments that
  <code>from()</code> and <code>getBuffer()</code> accept. For most scripts, you
  do not need to worry about these options.
</p>

<h4>Mapped Models</h4>
<p>
  The
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/abstracts/MappedModel"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>MappedModel</code></a
  >
  base class inherits from <code>WritableModel</code>, and is used for models
  that map keys to values. At the time of writing, the two models that do so are
  <code>Package</code> and <code>StringTableResource</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The vast majority of methods you'll use to interact with packages and string
  tables come from this base class, so I highly recommend that you read through
  the docs.
</p>
<p>
  A key/value pair in a mapped model is called an <strong>entry</strong>. The
  most important thing to note about entries are their <code>key</code>,
  <code>value</code>, and <code>id</code> properties.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Mapped models are lists of key/value pairs, not actual mappings - therefore,
  keys are allowed to repeat. S4TK uses an internal <code>id</code> property
  that acts as a unique, constant identifier, but this ID does not exist in the
  actual file binaries.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  You generally do not have to worry about it, just know that it exists and is
  the preferred way to get and delete entries.
