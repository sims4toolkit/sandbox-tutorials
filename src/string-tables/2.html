<h2>String Table JSONs</h2>
<p>
  Using JSON for string tables is a bit niche, but when done correctly, can make
  your string management much easier.
</p>

<h4>Reading a STBL JSON</h4>
<p>
  The <code>StringTableResource</code> constructor is able to accept a list of
  objects containing key/value pairs - this is a JSON. This JSON can either be
  defined as an array literal, or it can be loaded from a JSON file.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of how you get your hands on the JSON, all you have to do is pass
  it into the constructor, and you'll have a string table with default entries.
</p>

  You can add, get, edit, and delete entries from these string tables just as
  you did with the string table you created from scratch on the previous page.
</p>

<h4>Writing a STBL JSON</h4>
<p>
  Once you have a <code>StringTableResource</code>, regardless of how it was
  made, you can turn it into a JSON with the <code>toJsonObject()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
  From there, you can do whatever you want with the JSON. Iterate over it, save
  it to a file, load it into another STBL - anything.
</p>

  The <code>toJsonObject()</code> method accepts some optional arguments. If you
  want to learn about them, check out the documentation.
