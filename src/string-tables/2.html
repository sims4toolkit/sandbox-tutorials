<h2>String Table JSONs</h2>
<p>
  Using JSON for string tables is a bit niche, but when done correctly, can make
  your string management much easier.
</p>

<h4>Reading a STBL JSON</h4>
<p>
  The <code>new StringTableResource()</code> constructor is able to accept a
  list of objects containing key/value pairs - this is a JSON. This JSON can
  either be defined as an array literal, or it can be loaded from a JSON file.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of how you get your hands on the JSON, all you have to do is pass
  it into the constructor, and you'll have a string table with default entries.
  You can add, get, edit, and delete entries from these string tables just as
  you did with the string table you created from scratch on the previous page.
</p>

<h4>Writing a STBL JSON</h4>
<p>
  Once you have a string table object, regardless of how it was made, you can
  turn it into a JSON with the <code>toJsonObject()</code> method. Check the
  docs for optional arguments that this method accepts.
</p>
<p>
  From there, you can do whatever you want with the JSON. Iterate over it, save
  it to a file, load it into another STBL - anything.
</p>
