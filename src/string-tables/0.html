<h2>StringTableResource</h2>
<p>
  When dealing with string tables, you'll need to use the
  <code>StringTableResource</code> class from @s4tk/models.
</p>

  This tutorial assumes that you are somewhat familiar with
  <a

    target="_blank"
    >mapped models</a
  >. If you are not, you should read the

  before this one.

<h4>Creating STBL</h4>
<p>
  To create a new, empty string table, you can use
  <code>new StringTableResource()</code>.
</p>

<h4>Adding Strings</h4>
<p>
  The <code>addAndHash(value: string)</code> method adds a string to the table,
  using its FNV32 hash as the key. However, hashing the value itself is not very
  safe in terms of making a unique hash.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, you should use
  <code>addAndHash(value: string, toHash: string)</code>, which hashes the
  <code>toHash</code> argument for the key instead. This is safer than hashing
  the value itself, because you can append your creator name to the front.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, if you know the exact key you want, you can use
  <code>add(key: number, value: string)</code>, which adds the key/string pair
  to the table.
</p>

<h4>Getting Strings</h4>
<p>
  Since a string table is a mapped model, each key/value pair is called an
  <strong>entry</strong>. Specifically, the entries in a string table are of the
  type
  <a
    href="https://sims4toolkit.com/#/docs/models/latest/types/StringEntry"
    target="_blank"
    ><code>StringEntry</code></a
  >, which has <code>id</code>, <code>key</code>, and
  <code>value</code> properties.
</p>
<p>You can get a string entry by its...</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID: <code>get(id: number)</code></li>
  <li>Key: <code>getByKey(key: number)</code></li>
  <li>Value: <code>getByValue(value: string)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally, you can use the <code>entries</code> property, which is a list
  of all of the entries in the string table. You can use this list to get
  entries by their index, or to loop/iterate over all of the entries.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Note that adding/removing entries to/from the <code>entries</code> list will
  NOT add/remove them from the string table - you MUST use the add/delete
  methods.
</p>

<h4>Editing Strings</h4>
<p>
  Once you have a <code>StringEntry</code> object, editing it is as easy as
  setting the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> properties.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  Note that string entries also have a property called
  <code>string</code>, which is just an alias for <code>value</code>.
</p>

<h4>Deleting Strings</h4>
<p>You can delete a string entry by its...</p>
<ul>
  <li>ID: <code>delete(id: number)</code></li>
  <li>Key: <code>deleteByKey(key: number)</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="footnote">
  If you're confused about IDs vs. keys, it is explained in the
  <a href="#/tutorials/intro-to-s4tk">Intro to S4TK tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
  For posterity, the key is what actually gets written to the string table, and
  the ID is a unique identifier that S4TK uses internally (just in case any keys
  are repeated).
