<h2>StringTableResource</h2>
<p>
  When dealing with string tables, you'll need to use the
  <code>StringTableResource</code> class from @s4tk/models.
</p>

<h4>Creating STBL</h4>
<p>
  To create a new, empty string table, you can use
  <code>new StringTableResource()</code>.
</p>

<h4>Adding Strings</h4>
<p>
  The <code>addAndHash(string)</code> method will add the given string to the
  table, and use its 32-bit hash as its key. While convenient, it may not be the
  best idea to use this function in production - you want to make sure that your
  string keys are unique.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>addAndHash(string, toHash)</code> method will add the given string
  to the table, and use the 32-bit hash of the <code>toHash</code> argument as
  its key. This is a bit "safer" than hashing the string itself, because you can
  append your creator name to the front, increasing the liklihood that your key
  will be unique.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the <code>add(key, string)</code> method will add the given string to
  the table with the given key. You can put in a fixed value for the key, or you
  can use the <code>fnv32()</code> function from @s4tk/hashing to generate a
  hash manually.
</p>

<h4>Getting Strings</h4>
<p>
  You can get a string entry by its key with the
  <code>getByKey(key)</code> method, or by its value with the
  <code>getByValue(value)</code> method. Note that the value must be an exact
  match, case sensitive, in order to return the entry. The entry that is
  returned is an object with <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> properties.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you can use the <code>entries</code> property, which is a list
  of all of the entries in the string table. You can use this list to get
  entries by their index, or to loop/iterate over all of the entries. Note that
  adding/removing entries to/from this list will NOT add/remove them from the
  string table - you MUST use the add/delete methods.
</p>

<h4>Editing Strings</h4>
<p>
  Once you get a reference to an entry, editing it is as easy as setting the
  <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> properties.
</p>

<h4>Deleting Strings</h4>
<p>
  To delete an entry with a known key, you can use the
  <code>deleteByKey(key)</code> method. If you don't know the key, though, you
  can fetch the entry you want to delete (by its value or index), and then
  delete it by its unique ID with <code>delete(id)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If you're confused what the difference between a <code>key</code> and an
  <code>id</code> is, it's quite simple. Keys are what the game uses, they
  identify which <em>strings</em> are which. IDs are what S4TK uses, they
  identify which <em>entries</em> are which. IDs are not a part of the string
  table, they are just used by S4TK to ensure uniqueness, since keys are NOT
  guaranteed to be unique (they should be, but it is technically valid for them
  to overlap).
