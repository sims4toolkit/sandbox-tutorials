<h2>String Table Binaries</h2>
<p>
  In order for the <code>StringTableResource</code> model to be useful at all,
  you need to be able to load one from a STBL binary, as well as write it as
  one. Fortunately, this is extremely easy.
</p>

<h4>Reading a STBL Binary</h4>
<p>
  Before you can create a <code>StringTableResource</code> object, you have to
  get your hands on a buffer that contains binary STBL data.
</p>
<p>
  In the sandbox, you can use <code>await Sandbox.import(filename)</code> to
  load a media file. This tutorial has an included media file called
  "Sample.stbl" that contains binary STBL data.
</p>

<h4>Writing a STBL Binary</h4>
<p>
  To save a <code>StringTableResource</code> object as a file, you have to get
  its buffer with the <code>getBuffer()</code> method. If you view the S4TK
  documentation, you'll see that this method has some optional arguments, but
  for the most part, you don't have to worry about them.
</p>
<p>
  In the sandbox, you can use <code>Sandbox.download(filename, buffer)</code> to
  save the string table to your computer.
</p>

<h4>Note about Node</h4>
<p>
  When using S4TK in Node, remember that <code>import()</code> and
  <code>download()</code> are not available. You'll have to use the
  <code>fs</code> Node module to read & write files.
