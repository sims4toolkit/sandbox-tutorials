<h2>String Table Binaries</h2>
<p>
  If you want to load an existing STBL into a <code>StringTableResource</code>,
  or want to write one to a file, you need to work with binary STBL buffers.
</p>

<h4>Reading a STBL Binary</h4>
<p>
  First, you have to get your hands on a buffer that contains binary STBL data.
  Then, you can use <code>StringTableResource.from(buffer)</code> to load it
  into a string table model.
</p>
<p>
  In the sandbox, you can use <code>await Sandbox.import(filename)</code> to
  load a media file. This tutorial has an included media file called
  "Sample.stbl" that contains binary STBL data.
</p>

<h4>Writing a STBL Binary</h4>
<p>
  To save a <code>StringTableResource</code> object as a file, you have to get
  its buffer with the <code>getBuffer()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
  In the sandbox, you can use <code>Sandbox.download(filename, buffer)</code> to
  save the string table to your computer.
</p>

<h4>Note about Node</h4>
<p>
  When using S4TK in Node, remember that <code>import()</code> and
  <code>download()</code> are not available. You'll have to use the
  <code>fs</code> Node module to read & write files.
